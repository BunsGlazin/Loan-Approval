# Loan-Approval

Machine Learning model development and comparison for approving a loan request.

**Process Flow**

* Data visualization (EDA)
* Data Preprocessing
* Training and tesing models

**Description**

This project report presents the development of machine learning models using Logistic Regression, Random forest and Descision tree algorithms. Their performance were compared using the accuracy metric. This project also presents the Exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the dataset used.

**Data**

The dataset information regarding the individual applying for a loan. The attributes include

* no_of_dependents : The total number of dependents the person has
* education : Whether the person is a graduate or not
* self_employed : Whether the person is self employed or not
* income_annum : Annual income of the person
* loan_amount : Amount of money requested as a loan
* loan_term : Period of time the loan is requested for
* cibil_score : Score ranging from 300-900 that denotes creditworthiness
* loan_status : Whether the loan request is approved or rejected

**Summary**

This project focused on developing and comparing machine learning models, namely Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree algorithms, for loan approval based on individual attributes such as the number of dependents, education, income, loan amount, loan term, and credit score. The models were trained, tested, and evaluated using accuracy metrics. Additionally, exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted to gain insights into the dataset's characteristics and to inform model development.
